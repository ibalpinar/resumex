### Installation

First, I would recommend that you install it with Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed on your system, you can just install Homebrew first.

https://brew.sh/

Install Nodejs v21.x

If you have Homebrew installed on your system, open your favorite Terminal and run the following commands:
```sh
$ brew update

$ brew install node@21
```
Note: If you use more than one Nodejs version, you can easily switch between Nodejs versions by installing NVM.
```sh
$ brew install mongodb-community@7.0

$ brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```
Clone the ResumeX repository with your favorite method, such as SSH:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ibalpinar/resumex.git

$ npm install

$ npm start
```
Note: The `npm start` command runs the `starts` script in the package.json file.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ibalpinar/resumex.git

$ npm install

$ npm start
```
You can run the application from an IDE or a code editor with a debugger by connecting to npm start.

You can also run the line directly from the terminal in the `start` script.
```sh
$ node --env-file config/dev.env src/index.js
```

<b>BTW, New participants are welcome! You can get involved in the project whenever you want, on any topic you wish to...</b>
